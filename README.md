# porcu-sv-ttk
Plugin to use the Sun Valley ttk theme in Porcupine

## Installation

Install sv-ttk inside Porcupine's venv
```
pip install sv-ttk
```

Copy `sun_valley_ttk.py` into Porcupine's extra plugins directory.

The `ttk_themes` plugin might need to be disabled, as sv-ttk can conflict with it.

# porcu-sv-ttk
Plugin to use the Sun Valley ttk theme in [Porcupine](https://github.com/Akuli/porcupine)

## Installation

Install sv-ttk inside Porcupine's venv
```
pip install sv-ttk
```

Copy `sun_valley_ttk.py` into Porcupine's extra plugins directory.

The `ttk_themes` plugin might need to be disabled, as sv-ttk can conflict with it.

You can select the theme in the settings dialog. Don't use the `UI themes` menu for that, as sv-ttk doesn't work that way, and will raise an error.
